\arguments{
\item{netdata}{A named list created by \code{\link{prepare_network_data}}
containing the continuity network data. Alternatively,
a \link[base]{data.frame} can also be used, but is recommended
only for quick or exploratory plotting of a basic continuity
diagram.}

\item{mark}{Character or character vector. Specifies which type of group
should be visually distinguished in the diagram. Options include
"parties", "cores", or c("candidate", "candidate name"). Defaults
to NULL (no group highlighting). See \emph{Details} and \emph{Examples} for
usage.}

\item{separate_groups}{Logical. If TRUE, groups of candidate lists are plotted
in separate rows on the y-axis, improving clarity for
group-level analysis. See \emph{Details}.}

\item{lists}{Character. Candidate lists to be included in the plot. Either
"all" (default) or "elected" to include only lists with at least
one elected candidate (councillor).}

\item{elections}{Character or character vector. Filters the range of elections
to be shown in the diagram. By default (\code{NULL}), all available
elections in the \code{netdata} object are included. You can specify:
individual elections (e.g., \verb{"1994", "2022"}), ranges (e.g.,
\code{"2002-"}, \code{"-2010"}, \code{"1994-2010"}) or combinations of both
(e.g., \code{"-1998, 2002, 2003.11, 2018-"}). See \emph{Details} and
\emph{Examples} for more information and usage.}

\item{show_elections_between}{Logical. If TRUE (default), the plot includes
all election periods between those selected via
the \code{elections} argument, even if no candidate
lists are present for those years because of the
selection. This is especially useful when
visualizing groups that did not run in every
election - empty columns help preserve the visual
continuity of timelines. Setting this to FALSE
will omit those gaps. Recommended to keep TRUE
when analyzing individual groups or when filtering
only a subset of elections.}

\item{parties}{Integer or character vector. Filters the so-called political
parties, i.e., groups of candidate lists identified via community
detection (see \code{\link{prepare_network_data}}). Use this
to display only selected parties, for example: \code{parties = c(1, 3, 5)}.
Party IDs can be found in the network data object under
\code{netdata$parties$node_attr$vertices}.}

\item{links}{Character. Determines which links between candidate lists are
plotted. \code{"continuity"} (default) includes only connections between
\emph{adjacent} elections. \code{"all"} includes links across any elections.
This option is mainly useful when analyzing a selection of
non-consecutive elections.}

\item{order_lists_by}{Character. Sorts candidate lists within each election
vertically. Options are: "votes" (default) or "seats".
If \code{separate_groups = TRUE}, sorting is applied within
each group.}

\item{order_groups_by}{Character vector. Used when \code{separate_groups = TRUE}.
Specifies the order of groups on the y-axis. Options:
"elections", "votes", "seats", or "none". Multiple
criteria can be provided in order of priority. To display
groups in the order they are listed in \code{netdata}, use
"none" or NULL. See \emph{Details} for more information.}

\item{personalization}{Logical. If TRUE, appends the coefficient of variation
of preferential votes to the candidate list name. See
\emph{Details} for interpretation. Default is FALSE.}

\item{coloured}{Logical. Specifies whether candidate lists of different groups
should be distinguished in colour (TRUE, default) or in grayscale
when using the \code{mark} argument. Ignored if \code{group_colours} is
provided.}

\item{group_colours}{A character vector of colour values (e.g., hex codes or
R colour names). Custom colours for marked groups. To
maintain the same colours when displaying the diagram
repeatedly, the number of colours (elements in the vector)
must match the number of all identified groups, even if
only a subset is shown. If NULL (default), the function
will select the most appropriate colour palette.}

\item{show_legend}{Logical. Whether to display the legend (only applies when
groups are marked). Default is TRUE.}

\item{show_candidate_networks}{Logical. If TRUE, an additional bottom panel
is drawn, displaying a snapshot of the
candidate-candidate network for each selected
election. Each snapshot shows the network
structure of candidates running in that specific
election, contextualised by candidates who
appeared in previous selected elections (as
determined by the \code{elections} argument).
Default is FALSE. See \emph{Details} for more
information.}

\item{plot_title}{Character. Title displayed above the diagram. Default is
NULL (no title).}

\item{...}{Additional technical arguments passed internally, primarily for
testing and improving the diagram display.}

\details{
\subsection{Recommendation about using the raw data}{

For more advanced use, especially when identifying political parties or
analyzing system stability, it is recommended to first process the election
data using \code{\link{prepare_network_data}}. This function builds the
necessary network structures and attributes also for groups of candidate lists
that sometimes takes few minutes but you would need to do it only once. Using
raw data frames as input in case of \code{plot_continuity} is intended mainly
for quick and basic visualizations, without the group identification.
}

\subsection{Usage of \code{mark} argument}{

A central feature of this function is the \code{mark} argument, which allows highlighting
of specific groups in the diagram. The most common options are \code{"parties"} or
\code{"cores"}, referring to communities of candidate lists detected through community
detection.

When using \code{mark = "parties"} or \code{"cores"}, you can further specify which groups
to highlight visually by adding their IDs (e.g., \code{mark = c("parties", 2, 5)}).
Party and core IDs are available in \code{netdata$parties$node_attr$vertices}
or \code{netdata$cores$node_attr$vertices}.

You can also highlight individual candidates by using \code{mark = c("candidate",
"Candidate Name")}, which will highlight the candidate lists on which the person
has appeared in colours of the candidate lists' groups.

You may combine the \code{mark} argument with group separation, and filtering.
}

\subsection{Groups separation}{

The \code{separate_groups} argument improves diagram readability by placing each
group on its own line. This is particularly helpful when analyzing continuity,
volatility, and structural reproduction of the party system.
}

\subsection{Elections filtering}{

Filtering elections using the \code{elections} argument is useful when dealing with
many elections that may not fit into a single figure in a report or publication.
In such cases, you can split the diagram into two parts (e.g., one with
\code{elections = "-2002"} and one with \code{elections = "2002-"}, so that the links
between the elections adjacent to the 2002 elections are not lost) and stack
them vertically.

When selecting non-consecutive elections, it is \strong{strongly recommended} to set
\code{links = "all"} to retain meaningful connections between candidate lists
across time. Otherwise, continuity may appear broken due to missing
intermediate elections.

For a meaningful continuity analysis, include at least two elections.
}

\subsection{About \code{order_groups_by} argument}{

The \code{order_groups_by} argument is relevant only when \code{separate_groups = TRUE}.
You can sort groups by \code{"elections"}, \code{"votes"}, \code{"seats"}, or \code{"none"} (the
original order in the data). If multiple criteria are provided (e.g.,
\code{c("votes", "elections")}), they are applied in priority order. The criteria
of \code{"votes"} and \code{"seats"} will sort the groups according to the value of
the given criterion. The \code{"elections"} criterion ranks groups based on their
participation in the most recent election and falls back recursively to earlier
ones in case of ties.
}

\subsection{About \code{personalization} argument}{

The \code{personalization} option appends the coefficient of variation of preferential
votes to the name of each candidate list. A lower value may indicate a party's
electoral program voting, while higher variability may suggest a personalized
choice (for example, where voters support a prominent individual rather than
the whole candidate list). In the case of a limited number of preferential votes,
such an interpretation may be debatable and should therefore be used with caution.
}

\subsection{Candidate network snapshots}{

When \code{show_candidate_networks = TRUE}, the plot includes an additional bottom
panel visualising candidate-candidate network snapshots for the selected
elections.

Each snapshot displays the network of candidates running in that particular
election, together with candidates who appeared in earlier selected elections.
Candidates in the focal election are drawn as larger nodes, while candidates
from previous elections who did not run in that election are shown as smaller
background nodes. This allows users to inspect continuity, connectivity, and
the gradual formation or dissolution of clusters, as well as other structural
changes across electoral periods, even when the selected elections are not
consecutive.

If grouping information is available (e.g., community-detected \emph{parties} or
\emph{cores}), node colours represent the long-term group affiliation of each candidate.
Node boundaries, however, reflect the candidate lists used in the specific
election represented in each snapshot. This combination helps reveal
whether individual candidate lists are internally cohesive or composed of
candidates from different longer-term groupings, potentially indicating later
fragmentation (splits), mergers, or realignments in subsequent elections.

The candidate network snapshots can also be combined with
\code{mark = c("candidate", "<name>")}, which highlights the chosen candidate across
the continuity diagram and in all snapshot networks. Marking works both with
and without identified groupings.

The snapshots do not require the selected elections to be consecutive; if
non-adjacent elections are included, the panel still displays one snapshot per
election based on the available data.
}

\subsection{Additional arguments (\code{...})}{

The \code{...} argument is primarily intended for internal tuning and advanced use.
It can be used to pass optional control parameters that are not part of the
main user-facing interface and are therefore not listed in the formal
argument list. These settings may change between versions and should
generally not be needed in typical workflows.

One such option is \code{do_not_print_to_console = TRUE}, which suppresses
informational messages printed by \code{plot_continuity()} (for example, list
of detected groups). This can be useful in automated scripts, examples,
or pkgdown documentation where repeated console output would be distracting.
}

\subsection{Text encoding}{

Text encoding is controlled by a global option \code{lpanda.text_encoding}
with values "auto"|"utf8"|"ascii" (default "auto"). If needed, \code{text_encoding}
can be passed via \code{...}, e.g. \code{plot_continuity(netdata, text_encoding="ascii")}.
}
}
\note{
The \code{mark = "cores"} option is currently experimental, as the conversion
of their definition into code is still being sought, and may be subject to
change in future versions. Use with caution.
