Each record describes one candidate's run for office, including their candidate
list affiliation, position on the list, nominating party, political affiliation,
number of preferential votes, and whether they were elected or held specific
positions (mayor, deputy mayor, member of the executive body).

The dataset also includes contextual election-level information, such as the
number of eligible voters and ballots cast, which can be used to calculate
voter turnout and related indicators. These variables appear only once per
election and constituency (they may be stored in a single candidate row for
that election/constituency)
