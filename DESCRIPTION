Description: Provides functions to prepare, visualize, and analyse diachronic
    network data on local political actors, with a particular focus on
    the development of local party systems and identification of actor groups.
    Formalizes and automates a continuity diagram method that has been previously
    applied in research on Czech local politics, e.g. Bubenicek and Kubalek (2010,
    ISSN:1803-8220), Kubalek and Bubenicek (2012, ISSN:1803-8220), and Cmejrek,
    Bubenicek, and Copik (2010, ISBN:978-80-247-3061-5). The package also
    includes several example datasets derived from Czech municipal
    elections, compiled from official election results, field research, and
    previously published case studies on Czech local politics.
